## Firestore

Firestore: Use our flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data for client- and server-side development.

https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore

Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Like Firebase Realtime Database, it keeps your data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud products, including Cloud Functions.

Firebase is BaaS: Backend-as-a-Service

The best code is no code at all. Jeff Atwood

Firebase is an extension of "Google Cloud Platform" (GCP).

Firebase is SDK for frontend app.

A firebase project(i.e, cool-proj1) can have multiple web apps.

You need to run below command to configure firebase in a project

firebase init

Choose feautres: Hosting and Emulators (from the list: Database, Firestore, Functions, Hosting, Storag, Emulators, Remote Config).

WATCH VIDEO FROM FIRESHIP.IO for EMULATOR(emulators is just simulation of firebase services locally on our system, and that means we can run database records and cloud functions on our system without connecting to google cloud ). ADVANCE EMULATOR TECHNIQUES.

Firebase init adds secret to your github repo if you select autmatic deployment:
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_COOL_PROJ1.

For emulator setup: Choose the ``hosting`` option.

I choose emulator port to be 5005(default is use any available) and to install the emulator now(default is no).

### Rewriting routes in firebase.json file

Use rewrites property inside the hosting key in ``firebase.json`` to configure any redirects you want!!

e.g., 

```
"rewrites": [
	{
		"source": "**",
		"destination": "/index.html"
	}
]
```

### Starting the app

`firebase server` or `firebase emulators:start`

### Deployment

Use `firebase deploy` to deploy your app but IMO the app will be automatically deployed when you push a commit to github as I configured the ci with firebase as well.
